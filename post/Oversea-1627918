Just wow. While I have physics and a paper to write, I really need to <br />get this out. <br />Grace Wang. She's really something. <br /><br />She's quite useful to the media. Both sides are having a field day. The <br />chinese TV are branding her as this terrible traitor while western media is <br />holding her up as the lone voice of reason. They both are neglecting the <br />truth, what Grace really is, beyond the 9 minute Youtube video and glorious <br />interviews. <br /><br />When I first met her at a dinner, she immediately spilled her life story. I <br />thought, maybe she was being a slightly socially incompetent fob and trying <br />to make friends. I listened. What a good story it was.<br /><br />She told of how she was involved in a political group with some top lawyers <br />in China. They were trying to get the truth out of the Tiananmen square <br />incident. They wrote articles and blogs together on the subject. Then one <br />day, one of her friends involved in the group disappeared. They called her, <br />went to her house, tried everything, but she was no where to be found. Then <br />Grace and her parents start freaking out. Grace's dad, at the time the ex <br />mayor of Qingdao, afraid of Grace facing a similar fate, went to her files <br />in the city government and threw them out. She got a new name, and quickly <br />moved to South Korea. At the time, Grace told us that she already dropped <br />out of her high school in Qingdao because she was unsatisfied by the best <br />high school in Shandong province. She moved to Korea, and there she learned <br />English by watching American films. While she was there, she also slept <br />around with a lot of guys. Then she applied to Harvard and got rejected. The<br />next year, she applies again, to Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and Duke. She <br />gets accepted to all but Harvard. She chose to come to Duke because she got <br />the Robertson. She then turns down the Robertson because she didn't want the<br />restrictions set by the program. <br /><br />After the story finished, we were all pretty amazed. We were all thinking <br />that this seemingly innocent Chinese student is destined for greatness. <br />After we come back to my room, she proceeds to tell one of us about the guy <br />in the dorm she had sex with. I was quite shocked by this. She seemed so <br />innocent, and we had only been at Duke for less than 5 days. She says the <br />guy was a virgin and now he wants a relationship. We go to the common room, <br />she points him out, and he was playing pool at the other side of the room, <br />totally not paying attention to her. <br />Later on, Grace begins telling us many stories about herself. All she ever <br />talks about is herself.<br />As the stories piled on, they became inconsistent, and sometimes directly <br />contradicting. People begin question her trustworthiness. Eventually, after <br />months of lies and irrationality, people begin disliking her. For such a <br />trusting and kind dorm like Brown to dislike someone, you really have to be <br />special. And Grace is that special. Now we know she is a liar. She didn't go<br />to Korea or even participate in anything political. She even told people <br />that she wrote her own recommendations for college applications. She made up<br />stories to make herself seem impressive for colleges, and now, the western <br />media. <br /><br />She's overloading by taking around 6 courses. 2-3 of those are foreign <br />language courses. She was angry that the academic dean wouldn't let her do <br />more. Funny thing is, she's definitely not doing well in any of them. I've <br />heard her practice her German, and it is atrocious. <br />She also reads like a maniac. I don't really know what she reads, but it's <br />Chinese literature/philosophy and political theory. She prints hundreds of <br />pages a night to read, parades around with her stack of papers, telling <br />anyone who would listen, trying to impress another person of her political <br />acumen. <br />She shaved off her eyebrows the other day. Because 1: all her boy problems <br />will go away, and 2: pretty girls never make history.<br />She also makes up stories about how people ask to have sex with her or <br />perform sexual acts with her. <br />Is it me, or is she someone trying to convince herself that she's destined <br />for greatness? <br /><br />It would really take a really long time to really describe all my Grace <br />stories and I don't have time for it. But all I can say is, she has been <br />lifted up by western media as a martyr in this battle for Tib. And she's <br />drinking in every moment of it, because finally, she is being seen as a hero<br />. <br />What a silly, irrational girl. <br /><br />Oh how could I forget to mention, she wants to be president of China. <br /><br />--<br />--<br /><br />※ 来源:·水木社区 http://newsmth.net·[FROM: 123.120.48.*]
