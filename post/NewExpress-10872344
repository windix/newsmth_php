A lot of the Han Chi<br />nese own shops in the area and there are some hospitals in the vicinity.<br /><br />Chinese troops stand guard in Urumqi, July 8, 2009.<br /><br />Chinese troops stand guard in Urumqi, July 8, 2009.<br /><br />When we saw the protesters marching in the streets, we simply followed them.<br /> It was, in a way, a little dicey, because obviously there was raw emotion a<br />mong them. There is also raw emotion on the part of the Uyghurs. So, we had <br />to keep in mind safety and security. In fact, while we were shooting picture<br />s for our report, some of the protesters turned to us and told us, "stop sho<br />oting, stop shooting."<br /><br />We saw hundreds of Han Chinese holding sticks and pipes basically calling fo<br />r severe punishment of the Uyghurs, who they say committed serious crimes du<br />ring Sunday's deadly rioting.<br /><br />The Han Chinese protesters also say they are out to defend themselves if the<br />y have to. I saw policemen and local officials trying to talk to them and co<br />nvince the crowd to disperse. We haven't heard about any serious confrontati<br />ons between the Han Chinese protesters and Uyghurs, but we heard that the po<br />lice dispersed protesters in some places using tear gas.Video Watch how tens<br />ions remain high in Xinjiang 03<br /><br />When we got close to the Uyghur-populated area, we were stopped by the polic<br />e and told to get in their jeeps. They said it was for our own safety. They <br />probably were right. We may have been pushing our luck and could have gotten<br /> caught in potential confrontations and clashes.<br /><br />Before that, we stopped and talked with a doctor in front of a small traditi<br />onal Chinese hospital close to the People's Square. The doctor said the Han <br />Chinese are trying to defend themselves. He was very angry about the violenc<br />e reported on Sunday.<br /><br />He said that they are fed up with what they saw, they felt that it was unspe<br />akable that young people, old people and women were beaten up, helpless peop<br />le who just happened to be in the wrong place. So there is this very viscera<br />l anger among many Han Chinese.<br /><br />During the march on Tuesday, there were different groups, kind of in waves, <br />marching through the streets. A few times they converged. I would say it was<br /> pretty spontaneous. Pent up emotions, boiling over.<br /><br />Ethnic tensions run deep in this region, with minority groups such as the Uy<br />ghur Muslims complaining they are subjected to discrimination by the majorit<br />y Han, despite government guarantees of equal rights. The Uyghurs say they'v<br />e been victimized and that many of those killed in the recent violence were <br />Uyghurs.<br /><br />Local officials on Tuesday organized a press conference and they called in t<br />hree ethnic Uyghur religious leaders who condemned Sunday's violence. The vi<br />ce chairman of the Muslim Association said what happened on Sunday was again<br />st the spirit of the Quran, the holy book of Islam, and of Uyghur tradition <br />and religion.<br /><br />Don't Miss<br /><br />    * Fresh protests follow Uyghur crackdown<br /><br />    * China's Hu leaves G-8 to deal with ethnic unrest<br /><br />    * Uyghurs: China's remote Muslim minority<br /><br />    * In-depth:  China<br /><br />Right now (Wednesday morning), we are driving around Urumqi in a taxi and we<br /> see fairly light traffic. On our way we have seen anti-riot police taking p<br />ositions in major intersections. This is a build-up from yesterday -- the ar<br />rival of reinforcements of People's Armed Police. I talked with a local offi<br />cial Wednesday morning. She told me that it is very important that they show<br /> they are in charge and that they are taking measures to ensure the safety o<br />f residents.<br /><br />The local official told me this morning that, in a way, the protests on the <br />part of the Han Chinese were probably unavoidable because people were lookin<br />g to blow off steam, especially since the Internet has been down.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />The Internet, in other circumstances, has played a role in allowing people t<br />o release pent-up anger. But without the Internet, many of the Chinese, espe<br />cially the young, have bottled-up rage stoked by the images of violence they<br />'ve seen in the Chinese media. The local authorities are urging residents to<br /> show restraint.<br /><br />Wednesday morning, I saw a few people holding sticks but there were no signs<br /> of organized protests. I didn't see the kind of violence or antagonism I sa<br />w on Tuesday, but I think it is still a very fluid situation. <br /><br /><br />--<br /><br />※ 来源:·水木社区 newsmth.net·[FROM: 115.192.151.*]
