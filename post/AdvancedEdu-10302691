I did not hear back from you and in the meanwhile three other very strong students expressed interest in joining my group. At this point I am no longer able to offer you financial support since I have already made commitments to the other students.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I hope that you still decide to pursue your Ph.D. degree at Univ of XXXX.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />--<br /><br />※ 修改:·EEvsIE 于 Mar 29 12:43:19 2008 修改本文·[FROM: 211.99.222.*]<br />※ 来源:·水木社区 newsmth.net·[FROM: 211.99.222.*]
