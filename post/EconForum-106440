Because we don’t really know what’s go<br />ing to happen next. Everyone is saying, “Oh, look, the dollar is getting st<br />ronger!” [As it was when we spoke.] I say, that’s really temporary. It’s <br />simply because a lot of people need to cash in, they need U.S. dollars in or<br />der to pay back their creditors. But after a short while, the dollar may be <br />going down again. I’d like to bet on that!<br /><br />The overall financial situation in the U.S. is changing, and that’s what we<br /> don’t know about. It’s going to be changed fundamentally in many ways.<br /><br />Think about the way we’ve been living the past 30 years. Thirty years ago, <br />the leverage of the investment banks was like 4-to-1, 5-to-1. Today, it’s 3<br />0-to-1. This is not just a change of numbers. This is a change of fundamenta<br />l thinking.<br /><br />People, especially Americans, started believing that they can live on other <br />people’s money. And more and more so. First other people’s money in your o<br />wn country. And then the savings rate comes down, and you start living on ot<br />her people’s money from outside. At first it was the Japanese. Now the Chin<br />ese and the Middle Easterners.<br /><br />We—the Chinese, the Middle Easterners, the Japanese—we can see this too. O<br />kay, we’d love to support you guys—if it’s sustainable. But if it’s not,<br /> why should we be doing this? After we are gone, you cannot just go to the m<br />oon to get more money. So, forget it. Let’s change the way of living. [By w<br />hich he meant: less debt, lower rewards for financial wizardry, more attenti<br />on to the “real economy,” etc.]<br /><br />.....<br /><br />(记者问)<br /><br />About stock market derivatives and their role as source of evil:<br /><br />（高西庆答）<br /><br />If you look at every one of these [derivative] products, they make sense. Bu<br />t in aggregate, they are bullshit. They are crap. They serve to cheat people<br />.<br /><br />I was predicting this many years ago. In 1999 or 2000, I gave a talk to the <br />State Council [China’s main ruling body], with Premier Zhu Rongji. They wan<br />ted me to explain about capital markets and how they worked. These were all <br />ministers and mostly not from a financial background. So I wondered, How do <br />I explain derivatives?, and I used the model of mirrors.<br /><br />First of all, you have this book to sell. [He picks up a leather-bound book.<br />] This is worth something, because of all the labor and so on you put in it.<br /> But then someone says, “I don’t have to sell the book itself! I have a mi<br />rror, and I can sell the mirror image of the book!” Okay. That’s a stock c<br />ertificate. And then someone else says, “I have another mirror—I can sell <br />a mirror image of that mirror.” Derivatives. That’s fine too, for a while.<br /> Then you have 10,000 mirrors, and the image is almost perfect. People start<br /> to believe that these mirrors are almost the real thing. But at some point,<br /> the image is interrupted. And all the rest will go.<br /><br />When I told the State Council about the mirrors, they all started laughing. <br />“How can you sell a mirror image! Won’t there be distortion?” But this is<br /> what happened with the American economy, and it will be a long and painful <br />process to come down.<br /><br />I think we should do an overhaul and say, “Let’s get rid of 90 percent of <br />the derivatives.” Of course, that’s going to be very unpopular, because ma<br />ny people will lose jobs.<br /><br />.<br /><br />（记者问）<br /><br />About Wall Street jobs, wealth, and the cultural distortion of America:<br /><br />（高西庆答）<br /><br />I have to say it: you have to do something about pay in the financial system<br />. People in this field have way too much money. And this is not right.<br /><br />When I graduated from Duke [in 1986], as a first-year lawyer, I got $60,000.<br /> I thought it was astronomical! I was making somewhere a bit more than $80,0<br />00 when I came back to China in 1988. And that first month’s salary I got i<br />n China, on a little slip of paper, was 59 yuan. A few dollars! With a few y<br />uan deducted for my rent and my water bill. I laughed when I saw it: 59 yuan<br />!<br /><br />The thing is, we are working as hard as, if not harder than, those people. A<br />nd we’re not stupid. Today those people fresh out of law school would get $<br />130,000, or $150,000. It doesn’t sound right.<br /><br />Individually, everyone needs to be compensated. But collectively, this direc<br />ts the resources of the country. It distorts the talents of the country. The<br /> best and brightest minds go to lawyering, go to M.B.A.s. And that affects o<br />ur country, too! Many of the brightest youngsters come to me and say, “Okay<br />, I want to go to the U.S. and get into business school, or law school.” I <br />say, “Why? Why not science and engineering?” They say, “Look at some of m<br />y primary-school classmates. Their IQ is half of mine, but they’re in finan<br />ce and now they’re making all this money.” So you have all these clever pe<br />ople going into financial engineering, where they come up with all these com<br />plicated products to sell to people.<br /><br />（记者问）<br /><br />About the $700 billion U.S. financial-rescue plan enacted in October:<br /><br />（高西庆答）<br /><br />Finally, after months and months of struggling with your own ideology, with <br />your own pride, your self-right-eousness … finally [the U.S. applied] one o<br />f the great gifts of Americans, which is that you’re pragmatic. Now our peo<br />ple are joking that we look at the U.S. and see “socialism with American ch<br />aracteristics.” [The Chinese term for its mainly capitalist market-opening <br />of the last 30 years is “socialism with Chinese characteristics.”]<br /><br />It is joking, and many people are saying: “No, Americans still believe in f<br />ree capitalism and they think this is just a hiccup.” This is like our grea<br />t leader Deng Xiaoping, who said that it doesn’t matter if the cat is white<br /> or black, as long as it catches the mouse. It doesn’t matter what we call <br />this. It’s pragmatic.<br /><br />（记者问）<br /><br />With so much of China’s money at stake, did U.S. officials consult the Chin<br />ese about the rescue plan?<br /><br />（高西庆答）<br /><br />Not directly. We were talking to people there, and they were hoping that we <br />would be supportive by not pulling out our money. We know that by pulling ou<br />t money, we’re not serving anyone’s good. Including ourselves. [This is th<br />e famous modern “balance of financial terror.” If Chinese officials starte<br />d pulling assets out of the U.S. and touched off a run on the dollar, their <br />vast remaining dollar holdings would plummet in value.] So we’re trying to <br />help, at least by not aggravating the problem.<br /><br />But I think at the end of the day, the American government needs to talk wit<br />h people and say: “Why don’t we get together and think about this? If Chin<br />a has $2 trillion, Japan has almost $2 trillion, and Russia has some, and al<br />l the others, then—let’s throw away the ideological differences and think <br />about what’s good for everyone.” We can get all the relevant people togeth<br />er and think up what people are calling a second Bretton Woods system, like <br />the first Bretton Woods convention did.<br /><br />（记者问）<br /><br />On what might make the Chinese government start taking its dollars out of Am<br />erica (I began the question by saying that China would hurt itself by pullin<br />g out dollar assets—at which he interjected, “in the short term”—and the<br />n asked about the long-term view):<br /><br />（高西庆答）<br /><br />Today when we look at all the markets, the U.S. still is probably the most v<br />iable, the most predictable. I was trained as a lawyer, and predictability i<br />s always very important for me.<br /><br />We have a PR department, which collects all the comments about us, from Chin<br />ese newspapers and the Web. Every night, I try to pick a time when I’m in a<br /> relatively good mood to read it, because most of the comments are very crit<br />ical of us. Recently we increased our holdings in Blackstone a little bit. N<br />ow we’re increasing a little bit our holdings in Morgan Stanley, so as not <br />to be diluted by the Japanese. People here hate it. They come out and say, “<br />Why the hell are you trying to save those people? You are the representative<br /> of the poor people eating porridge, and you’re saving people eating shark <br />fins!” It’s always that sort of thing.<br /><br />（记者问）<br /><br />And how should Americans feel about the growing Chinese presence in their ec<br />onomy? Isn’t it natural for them to worry that China will keep increasing i<br />ts stake in American debt and assets—or that China won’t, essentially cutt<br />ing America off?<br /><br />（高西庆答）<br /><br />I can understand why Americans might feel that way. But, talking with my law<br />yer head once again, it’s not relevant to discuss how Americans “should” <br />think. We should discuss how Americans might think.<br /><br />This concern is not really about China itself. It could be any country. It c<br />ould be Japan, or Germany. This generation of Americans is so used to your s<br />upremacy. Your being treated nicely by everyone. It hurts to think, Okay, no<br />w we have to be on equal footing to other people. “On equal footing” would<br /> necessarily mean that sometimes you have to stoop to appear to be humble to<br /> other people.<br /><br />And you can’t think as a soldier. You put yourself at the enemy end of ever<br />yone. I grew up during the Cultural Revolution, when people really treated o<br />ther people like enemies. I grew up in an environment where our friends, our<br /> relatives, people I called Uncle or Auntie, could turn around and put a nas<br />ty face to me as a small child. One time, Vladimir Lenin told Gorky, after r<br />eading Gorky’s autobiography, “Oh my god! You could have become a very nas<br />ty person!” Those are exactly the words one of my dear professors told me a<br />fter hearing what I went through.<br /><br />But over the years, I believe I learned to be humble. To treat other people <br />nicely. I learned that, from a social point of view, no matter how lowly sta<br />tured a person you are talking to, as a person, they are the same human bein<br />g as you are. You have to respect them. You have to apologize if you inadver<br />tently hurt them. And often you have to go out of your way to be nice to the<br />m, because they will not like you simply because of the difference in social<br /> structure.<br /><br />Americans are not sensitive in that regard. I mean, as a whole. The simple t<br />ruth today is that your economy is built on the global economy. And it’s bu<br />ilt on the support, the gratuitous support, of a lot of countries. So why do<br />n’t you come over and … I won’t say kowtow [with a laugh], but at least, <br />be nice to the countries that lend you money.<br /><br />Talk to the Chinese! Talk to the Middle Easterners! And pull your troops bac<br />k! Take the troops back, demobilize many of the troops, so that you can save<br /> some money rather than spending $2 billion every day on them. And then tell<br /> your people that you need to save, and come out with a long-term, sustainab<br />le financial policy.<br /><br />（记者问）<br /><br />Although Gao has frequently mentioned Chairman Mao’s maxim—“Go with the R<br />epublicans. They’re predictable!”—he obviously was hoping for a “change”<br /> agenda under the Democrats:<br /><br />（高西庆答）<br /><br />The current conditions can’t go on. It is time for the new government, unde<br />r Obama or even McCain, to really tell people: “Look, this is wartime, this<br /> is about the survival of our nation. It’s not about our supremacy in the w<br />orld. Let’s not even talk about that any more. Let’s get down to the very <br />basics of our livelihood.”<br /><br />I have great admiration of American people. Creative, hard-working, trusting<br />, and freedom-loving. But you have to have someone to tell you the truth. An<br />d then, start realizing it. And if you do it, just like what you did in the <br />Second World War, then you’ll be great again!<br /><br />If that happens, then of course—American power would still be there for at <br />least as long as I am living. But many people are betting on the other side.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--<br />The only way to be truly statified, is to do what you believe is a great job<br />; the only way to do a great job, is to love what you do.<br /><br /><br />※ 修改:·v2 于 Jan 27 00:07:37 2009 修改本文·[FROM: 219.237.160.*]<br />※ 来源:·水木社区 newsmth.net·[FROM: 124.116.85.*]
