NV still insists on stonewa<br />lling and spinning because the cost of owning up to the problem could very wel<br />l sink the company.<br /><br />If you haven't been following the story, the short version, up till now, is th<br />at all G84 and G86 chips are bad. Nvidia is blaming everyone under the sun, bu<br />t denying they have any hand in the failures. While this may sound plausible,<br />technical analyses by people intimately involved in the requisite semiconducto<br />r technologies tell The INQ that it is a bunch of bull: NV simply screwed up.<br />Badly. If it was a problem with the suppliers, NV would not be paying out more<br /> than the chip cost, much less gagging OEMs: it would simply be passed along.<br /><br /><br />In any case, the official story is that there was a small batch of parts given<br /> only to HP that went bad. That was comprehensively proved wrong when Dell, Ap<br />ple, Asus, Lenovo and everyone else under the sun also had problems. NV AR rec<br />alled the parts and recanted the story about it only being an EOL test run. Ba<br />d fibbers, no cookie. They still stuck to the story about it being only laptop<br /> parts, and that it was under control.<br /><br />If you think it is under control now, the following is part of an email sent M<br />onday by a very tech-savvy reader. "We just got our first casualty from the Nv<br />idia mobile graphics [expletive deleted]. Laptop used by one of our senior eng<br />ineers started acting up this past weekend. Won't boot except in SAFE mode. Ca<br />lled Dell, they tried a few things, gave up, stated it was the graphics module<br />, and said that because they were SO swamped dealing with that issue, they wer<br />e just going to send a completely new laptop!"<br /><br />There are two messages here whi**ave echoes in earlier emails received over th<br />e past few weeks. First is that Dell is replacing full laptops over this, cont<br />rary to what they claim (read the comments here and here for more). The second<br /> is that the small 'under control' problem is far from that. If they had a han<br />dle on it, they would not be so far behind and drowning in backorders. Anyone<br />want to bet Dell isn't going to get stuck with the bill here?<br /><br />To make matters more laughable, the fix that NV is forcing on Dell, HP and eve<br />ryone else does not fix the problem, it simply makes it less likely to occur d<br />uring the warranty period. With HP now offering an extended warranty period, a<br />nd Dell looking likely to do the same, this will only multiply the cost. Add i<br />n the fact that Nvidia is sending out defective parts as replacements (there a<br />re no good ones), and you have a recipe for a long and expensive tale.<br /><br />That is where we stand now - NV is simply stonewalling everyone and the costs<br />are adding up. How adult of them. The question of why still remains though, an<br />d with another little tidbit of information, it becomes quite clear. There was<br /> a digitimes article on July 25, here if you are a subscriber, that said: "Due<br /> to Nvidia not clearly explaining the details of the faults reported in its no<br />tebook GPUs, some channel vendors have demanded graphics card makers issue a r<br />ecall for desktop-based discrete graphics cards using the same GPU core, accor<br />ding to sources at graphics card makers."<br /><br />Reading that, it sounds a mite odd: why would Nvidia keep the partners in the<br />dark like that? They have to be told what the real story is for business reaso<br />ns, right? When you see stories like these, it is very likely that they are no<br />t what they seem, and that the story is simply a nice face-saving Asian '**o'<br />applied with a backhand.<br /><br />A little digging revealed what this, and more, is all about, and it's far ugli<br />er than just the 'notebook' version. It seems that four board partners are see<br />ing G92 and G94 chips going bad in the field at high rates. If you know what f<br />ailures look like statistically, they follow a Poisson distribution, aka a bel<br />l curve. The failures start out small, and ramp up quickly - very quickly. If<br />you know what you are looking for, you can catch the signs early on. From the<br />sound of the backchannel grumblings, the failures have been flagged already, a<br />nd NV isn't playing nice with their partners.<br /><br />Why wouldn't they? Well, the G92 chip is used in the 8800GT, 8800GTS, 8800GS,<br />several mobile flavours of 8800, most of the 9800 suffixes, and a few 9600 var<br />iants just to confuse buyers. The G94 is basically only the 9600GT. Basically<br />we are told all G92 and G94 variants are susceptible to the same problem - bas<br />ically they are all defective. Any guesses as to how much this is going to cos<br />t?<br /><br />From the look of it, all G8x variants other than the G80, and all G9x variants<br /> are defective, but we have only been able to get people to comment directly o<br />n the G84, G86, G92 and G94, and all variants thereof. Since Nvidia is not ack<br />nowledging the obvious G84 and G86 problems, don't look for much word on this<br />new set either - if they can bury it, it will drop their costs.<br /><br />In the end, what it comes down to is that the problem is far bigger than they<br />are admitting, and crosses generational lines, process lines, and OEM lines. N<br />vidia is quick to point the finger at everyone but themselves, but after a whi<br />le, the facts strain those cover stories well past breaking point. There is a<br />common engineering failure here - this problem is far too widespread for it to<br /> be anything else. The stonewalling, denials and partner gagging is simply a l<br />ast-ditch attempt at wallet covering.<br /><br /><br />With OEMs extending warranties, Nvidia is going to have to cover a lot of lapt<br />ops for a long time. Desktop boards are going bad as well now, contrary to the<br /> statements of Nvidia PR and AR, and the hole keeps getting deeper and deeper.<br /> I wonder if they can ever come clean and survive.<br /><br />--<br /><br />※ 来源:·水木社区 newsmth.net·[FROM: 211.99.222.*]
