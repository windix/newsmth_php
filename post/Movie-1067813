It also gave the world Jet Li, and has now delivered another martial arts superstar--Wu Jing! This is the first Hong Kong action flick to feature Jing in a lead role, and he doesn't let fans down with his amazing acrobatic skill and winning charm. Along for the ride is the ever-whacky Ronald Cheng, in a story that takes another look at the world of underground fighting. While the action sequences are sure to satisfy, FATAL CONTACT is also a surprisingly dramatic film with moving performances by the leads. Only a Hong Kong film like this can balance equal doses of amazing human skill paired with genuine emotional conflicts, and FATAL CONTACT delivers on both ends. <br />--<br /><br />※ 来源:・水木社区 http://newsmth.net・[FROM: 211.103.174.*]
