A<br />laptop that now runs on battery for two hours could operate for 20 hours, a<br />boon to ocean-hopping business travelers.<br /><br />"It's not a small improvement," Cui said. "It's a revolutionary development.<br />"<br /><br />The breakthrough is described in a paper, "High-performance lithium battery<br />anodes using silicon nanowires," published online Dec. 16 in Nature<br />Nanotechnology, written by Cui, his graduate chemistry student Candace Chan<br />and five others.<br /><br />The greatly expanded storage capacity could make Li-ion batteries attractive<br />to electric car manufacturers. Cui suggested that they could also be used<br />in homes or offices to store electricity generated by rooftop solar panels.<br /><br />"Given the mature infrastructure behind silicon, this new technology can be<br />pushed to real life quickly," Cui said.<br /><br />The electrical storage capacity of a Li-ion battery is limited by how much<br />lithium can be held in the battery's anode, which is typically made of<br />carbon. Silicon has a much higher capacity than carbon, but also has a<br />drawback.<br /><br />Silicon placed in a battery swells as it absorbs positively charged lithium<br />atoms during charging, then shrinks during use (i.e., when playing your iPod<br />) as the lithium is drawn out of the silicon. This expand/shrink cycle<br />typically causes the silicon (often in the form of particles or a thin film)<br />to pulverize, degrading the performance of the battery.<br /><br />Cui's battery gets around this problem with nanotechnology. The lithium is<br />stored in a forest of tiny silicon nanowires, each with a diameter one-<br />thousandth the thickness of a sheet of paper. The nanowires inflate four<br />times their normal size as they soak up lithium. But, unlike other silicon<br />shapes, they do not fracture.<br /><br />Research on silicon in batteries began three decades ago. Chan explained: "<br />The people kind of gave up on it because the capacity wasn't high enough and<br />the cycle life wasn't good enough. And it was just because of the shape<br />they were using. It was just too big, and they couldn't undergo the volume<br />changes."<br /><br />Then, along came silicon nanowires. "We just kind of put them together,"<br />Chan said.<br /><br />For their experiments, Chan grew the nanowires on a stainless steel<br />substrate, providing an excellent electrical connection. "It was a fantastic<br />moment when Candace told me it was working," Cui said.<br /><br />Cui said that a patent application has been filed. He is considering<br />formation of a company or an agreement with a battery manufacturer.<br />Manufacturing the nanowire batteries would require "one or two different<br />steps, but the process can certainly be scaled up," he added. "It's a well<br />understood process."<br /><br />Also contributing to the paper in Nature Nanotechnology were Halin Peng and<br />Robert A. Huggins of Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford, Gao Liu<br />of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Kevin McIlwrath and Xiao Feng<br />Zhang of the electron microscope division of Hitachi High Technologies in<br />Pleasanton, Calif.<br /><br />--<br /><br />※ 来源:・WWW 未名空间站 海外: mitbbs.com 中国: mitbbs.cn・[FROM: 72.54.]<br />全文链接  ：http://mitbbs.com/article/ChinaNews/29985885_3.html<br />同主题链接：http://mitbbs.com/article_t/ChinaNews/29985885.html<br /><br />--<br />Rulers, Statesmen, Nations, are wont to be emphatically commended to the <br />teaching which experience offers in history. But what experience and history <br />teach is this, - that peoples and governments never have learned anything <br />from history, or acted on principles deduced from it.   ---Hegel<br />   <br /><br /><br />※ 修改:・dahuang 于 Dec 20 01:47:13 修改本文・[FROM: 133.70.80.*]<br />※ 来源:・水木社区 newsmth.net・[FROM: 133.70.80.*]
