The suspects all come from the heavily Muslim province of Xinjiang on the north-western border.<br /><br />During a visit to Japan, the da-lai Lama, the ti-betan spiritual leader, struck a conciliatory note. He said the Chinese people deserved the Olympics “despite unfortunate events in ti-bet”.<br /><br />But he welcomed support for the ti-betan cause seen in this week’s protests. “It is their right to criticise. I have no right to say ‘Shut up’,” he said. He supported only non-violent protests, however.<br /><br />The appeal to boycott French goods appeared on the internet on Wednesday and has spread widely among young Chinese. A web page bearing a petition appeared to have been blocked on Thursday afternoon.<br /><br />Companies named in the campaign include luxury brands owned by LVMH, such as Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, and the cosmetics group L’Oréal, which has a large business in China.<br /><br />The torch relay in London was badly disrupted and the route of the San Francisco leg was changed at the last minute to avoid protests, but it is the events in Paris that appear to have angered Chinese most.<br /><br />Internet postings complained about the banner in support of human rights draped outside Paris city hall. A photograph of a man trying to grab the torch from a Chinese girl in a wheelchair drew many responses. The man wore a hat in the colours of the ti-betan flag.<br /><br />Several foreign brands in China have suffered damaging firestorms of internet criticism in recent years. A campaign against Japanese companies three years ago had little lasting impact.<br /><br />Indonesian officials said on Thursday they had cancelled an April 22 Olympic torch relay around Jakarta. After receiving a request from Beijing, they have changed the route to confine the torch to the vicinity of the main sports stadium.<br /><br />Additional reporting by John Aglionby in Jakarta<br />Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2008<br /><br /><br />--<br /><br />http://www3.newsmth.org/att.php?p.872.34268.474.jpg<br /><br /><br />※ 来源:·水木社区 newsmth.net·[FROM: 59.151.45.*]
