I am sorry to know that you do not have a position for me. I would like to thank you for your time reviewing my application. I also appreciate the opportunity to learn more about your and other groupleaders' wonderful research work while preparing for the application. I wish myself the best of luck in future. <br /><br />Anyway, after careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I feel so sorry for you that you rejected me due to the grant problem which is unexpected and incredible. This will be your loss. Maybe you are a good scientist, but you failed to prove that you are a nice person when you broke faith. It is really very surprised that you asked some one to participate in an interview, you promised to give him offer and he did get the official offer, but suddenly you retracted the offer. It is really hard for me to accept it. This is a good lesson from which I learnt much. Thank you. I know that in future I can never be credulous, even if it is a professor that makes the commitment. If you hadn't promised me the offer and asked me to refuse other offers, maybe I would still have other opportunities.<br /><br />I think it is good that you expressed this now, otherwise it could have been a problem for me later if I work in your lab. You may easily let anyone down and sometimes don't keep your words. That may be your style but I couldn't like it.<br /><br />Thank you for your time. Best of luck in rejecting future applicants.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />******<br />--<br />辛夷坞<br />王维<br />木末芙蓉花，山中发红萼。<br />涧户寂无人，纷纷开且落。<br /><br />※ 来源:·水木社区 http://newsmth.net·[FROM: 61.50.139.*]
