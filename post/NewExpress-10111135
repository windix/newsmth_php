Government officials in<br />Thailand, one of the world’s largest meat exporters, have started referring<br />to the disease as “Mexican flu.” An Israeli deputy health minister — an<br />ultra-Orthodox Jew — said his country would do the same, to keep Jews from<br />having to say the word “swine.” However, his call seemed to have been<br />largely ignored.<br /><br />The World Organization for Animal Health, which handles veterinary issues<br />around the world, issued a statement late Monday suggesting that the new<br />disease should be labeled “North American influenza,” in keeping with a<br />long medical tradition of naming influenza pandemics for the regions where<br />they were first identified. This has included the Spanish flu of 1918 to<br />1919, the Asian flu of 1957 to 1958 and the Hong Kong flu of 1967 to 1968.<br /><br />The debate is likely to continue as scientists and health authorities try to<br />trace the disease. While all signs now point to Mexico as the epicenter,<br />the genetic material in the virus there was a swine influenza virus of<br />Eurasian origin. And influenza viruses tend to emerge from Asia.<br /><br />Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China called for stepped up measures on Tuesday<br />to prevent and control any possible cases of swine flu that might show up<br />in the country.<br /><br />Many medical historians believe that the Asian and Hong Kong flus started in<br />southeastern China near Hong Kong, where very high densities of people live<br />in close proximity to hogs and chickens in rural areas and can share their<br />viruses. Some historians also suggest that the Spanish flu also started in<br />southeastern China.<br /><br />But flu specialists in Asia said that the new virus probably did not make<br />the jump from animals to people in Asia.<br /><br />“If that is the case, you would see a lot of infections in Asia by now,”<br />said Subash Morzaria, the regional manager for Asia and the Pacific at the<br />Emergency Center for Transboundary Diseases, which is part of the United<br />Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization.<br /><br />The neuraminidase genetic segment of the virus, which gives the virus its “<br />N1” name and controls the ability of the virus to break out of infected<br />cells, comes from a Eurasian strain of swine flu, Dr. Yuen Kwok-yung, a<br />microbiologist at Hong Kong University. But he added that so many pigs are<br />moved across national borders that it is impossible to place the location<br />more precisely. On the other hand, pigs carry many diseases and rules<br />regarding their import are export are strict.<br /><br />There seems little indication of any outbreak of the new flu in China. There<br />have been no recent surges in illnesses among pigs or pig farmers,<br />according to Ben Boake, the executive vice president of the Henan Zhongpin<br />Food Company Ltd., one of China’s largest pork processors.<br /><br />Millions of pigs died in China two years ago in an epidemic so severe that<br />it pushed pork prices up 90 percent. Veterinarians attributed the deaths at<br />the time mainly to blue-ear disease, which does not affect humans, but also<br />to swine flu. The Chinese government did not issue a public report assessing<br />the outbreak and provided very few details to international organizations. <br />--<br /><br />※ 来源:·水木社区 http://newsmth.net·[FROM: 139.78.10.*]
