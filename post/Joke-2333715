Moving on ..<br /><br />Dear friends,<br />After 13 years and 2 beautiful children together, Yale and I have parted our <br />ways. Yale moved out last week.<br /><br />Dear Diane/Tao Dan Yang,<br />Over the past couple of years, you knew everything about my family. You knew <br />when my kids had their soccer tournaments, you knew when they had their <br />swimming practices. You even knew their baby nicknames. On December 18th, <br />2009, on a noon flight, I took my children to the U.S. for Christmas <br />vacation. On the very same day, December 18th, 2009, on an afternoon flight, <br />you and Yale took off for the beaches of Phuket and shopping streets of <br />Bangkok for Christmas vacation. Diane, as a fellow woman, I often wondered if <br />the level of ecstasy this vacation had brought you equates to the level of <br />devastation this vacation had brought to my children and me. Diane, I often <br />asked myself what was it like for you to sleep in the arms of another woman's <br />husband, other children's father? I wondered if you ever thought about us, <br />the children and the wife, that we are made of flesh and blood, that we have <br />feelings, that we could get hurt, very hurt, devastatingly hurt. I pondered <br />if you knew you were destroying a family, if you knew your joy would bring <br />endless tears to us.<br /><br />We went to Beijing last week for Chinese New Year. Your clothes were in our <br />Beijing home. My son screamed:" Mommy, don't touch those, they are <br />disgusting! Set them on fire, burn them to hell. They are the devil's cloth!" <br />My children are hurt. My daughter, 9 years old, now says "Mommy, I don't ever <br />want to get married." My son, 8 years old, says "Diane is our Voldemort!" The <br />psychological damage this affair has done to my children is catastrophic. <br />They are forever emotionally damaged. With this, I announce you the winner.<br />How do I feel, Diane? This affair is like 10 thousand knives stabbing and <br />chopping my heart all at once. This affair has left me in so much pain that I <br />don't know how to heal myself. This affair has taught me tear supply can <br />actually be infinite. This affair has crushed me, leaving me a corpse walking <br />around with no heart. I don't know how to deal with this kind of pain. I <br />don't know how to move on. But I have children. I must move on. Diane, I pray <br />to God that you will never have to experience this kind of betrayal and hurt. <br />I wish you and Yale a happy life together because, after all, we are all <br />women and we all deserve to be happy.<br /><br />With sincere regards,<br />Lily<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />发件人: Yale Yang [mailto:yale.yang@gbridge.biz]<br />发送时间: 2010年2月23日 11:14<br />收件人: Zhang, Lily<br />抄送: Tao, Diane; yiyang_tao@ml.com; Sun, Yonghong; Winn, Sean; Stevens, Joe; <br />Dawson, Andrew; Morrison, Alastair; Huh, Charles; Chu, Mabel; Yee, Andrew; <br />cici779200@yahoo.com.cn; liyi@junhe.com; delh@junhe.com; josieshen@sbcglobal.n<br />et; xy@vicap.com; dcwyml@hotmail.com; charles@chicapital.com; euniqueyoung@yah<br />oo.com.hk; Shiu, Ruby; taeyubkim@sc.com; Lai, Daniel Xiao Ming; Li, Sherry <br />Shao Ling; Yang, Sean; Zhang, Ting; Cheung, Clara Siu Yum<br />主题: Re: Dear friends ... Moving on ...<br /><br />Lily,<br /><br />Please do not bring the personal issues to the public. The truth of the facts <br />is that our marriage had been falling apart 8 years ago, divorce had been in <br />discussion 5 years ago. Our issues are known to all the people in the word! <br />Diane had done nothing wrong for her part! I am firmly standing by and behind <br />Diane. I will certainly hope she will marry me one day soon!<br /><br />Trying to tell the people how evil I am and Diane is in this way is not going <br />to succeed! All the people, who knows you, me and our marriage, supported my <br />divorce, including my good friend Zhu Wei. I am sorry I have dragged everyone <br />into this. Lily please move on!<br /><br />Sincerely yours<br /><br />Yale<br /><br />___________________________________________________________________<br /><br />NB翻译！<br />———————————————————————————————————————<br />#<br /><br />先翻一下女的：<br />亲们：<br />在一起过了13年，生了俩孩子，这个臭不要脸的男人还是跟我分手了，丫上周滚蛋了。<br /><br />小三：<br />这几年你对我们家了若指掌啊。我娃啥时候踢球啥时候游泳你tm都知道，连他们的小名儿<br />你都叫得出来。09年12月18，我前脚带着孩子去美国休假，你tm后脚就跟着臭不要脸的去<br />普吉岛厮混，去曼谷血拼。你丫也是一女人啊，知不知道你们tmd在那边有多high，我们<br />孤儿寡母在这边就有多惨？我要是你，才没脸跟另一个女人的丈夫，还是几个孩子的父亲<br />做这种龌龊事。我们孤儿寡母也是爹妈养大的，有血有肉的，你tm竟然忍心这么伤害我们<br />！你tm就是把你丫的幸福建立在我们的痛苦之上！<br /><br />上周我回北京过年，竟然看到你丫的衣服那么淫荡地挂在我家里。我儿子哭着喊着让我把<br />它们烧了，忒脏！我闺女才9岁，已经说她以后不敢嫁人了。我儿子8岁，说你是我们家的<br />灾星。你tmd把娃们幼小的心灵彻底整成杯具了。他们这辈子毁你手里了。算你狠！<br />我呢？我tm现在是万箭穿心啊，疼的没招没落的，悲伤已经逆流成河。我tm现在就是一行<br />尸走肉了。咋办，你说咋办。要不是为了娃们，我也活不下去了。小三儿，我祝福你，祝<br />福你这辈子别重蹈我的覆辙。祝你幸福，祝你全家幸福。<br /><br />黄脸婆：<br />家丑不要外扬好不？咱俩8年前就感情破裂了，5年前就在说离婚了。地球人都知道咱俩的<br />事了，关Diane啥事体？我挺着她呢，我俩马上就结婚了，爱咋地咋地吧。<br /><br />把我俩说成魔鬼，你就好受了是不？没门！认识咱们的人都说早该离了，撑啥撑啊，连老<br />朱也这么说。各位不好意思把你们拉进来打酱油了。算我求你了行不，你丫快滚。<br /><br />> 删除<br /><br /><br />英文原版可以当课外阅读（我指的是女人的，男人的就是一堆垃圾）<br />翻译的简直出神入化。我五体投地的佩服！你的翻译也同样会火的！<br />--<br />厄....<br /><br /><br />※ 来源:·水木社区 newsmth.net·[FROM: 59.108.44.*]
