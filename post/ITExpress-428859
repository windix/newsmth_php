I joined IBM at 2005 as summer intern. As a pure blue, I was always be proud of being a IBMer.<br />    However, to be honest, I am very very disappointed about the behavior or actions of IBM to the disaster we suffered last week. While we could get the continous information of donation from peer IT companies from the media, I could not see any proper actions from IBM.<br /> I do not think that the contribution of several PC servers or softwares is the right way to express the care from IBM to the people who are now suffering from the tragedy. As the top corporate citizen in China as we always regard by ourselves, IBM should do the right thing at the right time. However, I am proud of the employees of IBM China who act at once to make their personal contribution, but it is not from IBM, right?<br />   Last Thursday, when I called one local banking customer, I got following information from the customer,<br />   "It seems that we should turn to Huawei or Shenma in the future, at least, Chinese people will help Chinese people at critical moment, what have you IBM or Cisco done? Have you donated?"<br />   I was totally lost at that moment, I could not apply the selling skills told by IBM to tell my customer that we have donated two pc servers.<br />   I am sorry for my rudeness, but I am a Chinese people before I am a IBMer.<br /><br /><br />--<br />穿自己的衣服, 让别人裸奔去吧<br /><br /><br />※ 来源:·水木社区 newsmth.net·[FROM: 59.64.161.*]
