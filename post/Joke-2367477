Every time we turned on tv set, the most common program we might see is advertisement. Commercial is every where but not only on tv. Bus stops, city metros, elivators in office buildings, even the lighter that the restaurant provided free we could find advertise on it. Could you imagine a world without advertisement?<br /><br />There is no doubt that commercials give us rich information to help us find out what we need and how we get it. For example, I would not notice that nearby my office building there stands a not eye-catching little coffee shop in the street cornor with its unique style without the commercial paper which put into the office door through the crevice. And I could really miss that tasty coffee on the afternoon break. Sometimes I think I should be thankful with the information that advertisement brings.<br /><br />On the other hand, advertisement could be bothering. Have you ever drove a very long road to a beautiful beach and got bored in journey? Let's turn on the radio and find out something interesting, rocks, jazz, pop, even talk shows. Guess what? All you can hear is medical advertisement. Calcium pills for senior people, birth control pills for young attractive women, and viagra for desperate middle-aged men. After dozens of minutes surfing, all you want to do is kicking the stereo. And this is not the worst scenario, after all you can turn it off. The worst things are on my appartment door: escort service promotion card. For god sake, I am a decent girl with a decent boyfriend!<br />--<br />你做梦都想着我，我很感动<br />但下次能不能不要做噩梦了<br />做个春梦吧<br /><br /><br />※ 修改:·eamon 于 Apr 14 00:35:16 2010 修改本文·[FROM: 221.221.104.*]<br />※ 来源:·水木社区 newsmth.net·[FROM: 221.221.104.*]
