Mendes boasts Barca stars Deco, Rafael Marquez and former players Thiago Motta and Ricardo Quaresma on his books.<br /><br />At FIFA's World Player of the Year awards in Zurich last month, Ronaldo admitted: "Spain is a fantastic competition, very attractive, where very attacking football is played."<br /><br />He added: "Only God knows the future, but I would like to discover the difference between playing in England and Spain." <br /><br /><br />--<br /><br />※ 来源:・水木社区 newsmth.net・[FROM: 221.219.119.*]
