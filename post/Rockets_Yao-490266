So what if Battier went to Duke? You can't hold that against him. He didn't know any better when he signed there.<br /><br />Why Houston does it: The deal knocks them under the luxury tax and makes the Rockets a little more interesting as a title contender -- they could go small with Artest at the 4 and/or run plays for him at crunch time, and he'd give them a fiestiness and an edge they don't quite have right now. The Rockets seem a little soft to me. I'm not saying it's Battier's fault, but he's the best trade chip for them because of his contract and his pedigree. You could always use Shane Battier on your team. I like this deal for both teams, actually. <br /><br />火箭将使用Shane Battier+Kirk Snyder +08年第一轮选秀权交易Ron Artest +08年第二轮选秀权,目前莫雷正身处Sacramento和国王高层商讨交易的可行性,后续报道请大家等待!!!<br /><br />--<br /><br />※ 修改:·SagaFi 于 Feb 22 00:17:16 修改本文·[FROM: 211.99.222.*]<br />※ 来源:·水木社区 newsmth.net·[FROM: 59.66.96.*]
