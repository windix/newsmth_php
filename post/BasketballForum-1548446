He grabbed his knee and rolled around <br />in obvious pain.<br /><br />The Rockets said it was a knee strain, but you knew it was more <br />than that. An emotional Mutombo confirmed it after the game when <br />asked if his season was over.<br /><br />"No," said Mutombo. "It's over for me for my career.<br /><br />"I might need surgery," said Mutombo. "I'm going to be around for <br />as far as we can go in the championship run. I'll be with my <br />teammates in support and give them the same love that they give to <br />me, but for me, basketball... it's over."<br /><br /><br />--<br />美女，请适可而止，好吗？<br /><br />※ 来源:·水木社区 http://newsmth.net·[FROM: 192.5.246.*]
