However,<br />not all PhD would be eligible for the popular "Green Card".<br /><br />As per the bill introduced by Jeff Flake, Republican Congressman from<br />Arizona, only those foreign nationals having completed PhDs in science,<br />technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) would be eligible to directly<br />apply.<br /><br />If passed, the Stopping Trained in America PhDs from Leaving the Economy (<br />STAPLE) Act (HR 1791), would end up benefiting the Indians and Chinese the<br />most, as students from these two countries account for a majority of the PhD<br />students in the United States.<br /><br />The bill also say that such PhD holders be exempted from the numerical quota<br />of H-1B visas. <br /><br />--<br />博士生，研究生，本科生，生生不息<br />上一届，这一届，下一届，届届失业<br />愿读服输<br /><br /><br />※ 来源:·水木社区 newsmth.net·[FROM: 150.135.222.*]
