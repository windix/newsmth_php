Photographs and a video of the student from the rally have<br />also been posted on several popular Chinese-language forums. <br /><br />"I received all kinds of weird e-mails and phone calls," she said. "I think <br />it is all thanks to the DCSSA, who released all kinds of information."<br /><br />DCSSA President Zhizhong Li, a third-year graduate student in molecular <br />cancer biology, denied DCSSA involvement in publicizing the student's <br />information but acknowledged that messages containing the information had <br />been sent over the group's open e-mail listserv. The messages have since <br />been deleted to protect the student, he said.<br /><br />"I do not think they are from our organization," Li said. "We definitely don<br />'t support [the threats]."<br /><br />The student said she has received some messages calling for her to be burned<br />alive with oil.<br /><br />She said she filed a report with the Duke University Police Department <br />Friday. <br /><br />"I think this is not the time to die for my country," the student said. "I <br />love my life."<br /><br />DUPD has increased patrols around the student's dormitory and has offered <br />her personal protection, which she declined, said DUPD Maj. Gloria Graham.<br /><br />"She did report to us that there were some general threats made to her, or <br />things she perceived to be threats," Graham said. "We take harassing phone <br />call and e-mail cases all the time. I think we are all a little bit more <br />alarmed about this case."<br /><br />Though the student said she realized the dangers of participating in the <br />rally, she said she felt strongly about being involved.<br /><br />"I think this is one of the turning points of Chinese history, and I want to<br />be part of it," she said, emphasizing that she does not support tiban <br />independence. <br /><br />The student said there have also been consequences for her actions in China.<br /><br />"I know that I am on the Chinese government blacklist because of this," she <br />said, explaining that she had been informed of this by sources she declined <br />to name. "It just means I can never go back to China if I care about my <br />security. If I go back I might end up in jail forever."<br /><br />But Li dismissed the student's concerns about not being allowed back into <br />China.<br /><br />"People talk about that all the time and no matter," he said.<br /><br />The student's parents have also been targeted. Their contact information was<br />posted on several popular Chinese-language Internet forums. Some Internet <br />sources said their home was attacked, though the student said she has been <br />unable to confirm this with her parents, who declined to discuss the issue <br />when she contacted them via e-mail.<br /><br />At Duke, the leaders of several student organizations-including College <br />Republicans, the Duke Conservative Union, Duke Democrats, Students for <br />Academic Freedom, Duke Human Rights Coalition, Duke Students for an Ethical <br />Duke and the Duke-Israel Public Affairs Committee-have come together to <br />condemn the threats against the Chinese student, according to a statement. <br />They have blamed the threats on DCSSA and called for an investigation of the<br />group and a revocation of its student group status.<br /><br />"[DCSSA] on their official Web site put up her... information for no other <br />reason than to make sure that there would be retributive action in China," <br />said junior Daniel Cordero, vice president of College Republicans and <br />organizer of the coalition to condemn intimidation tactics.<br /><br />Li said he would like to discuss the issue with the organizations calling to<br />disband DCSSA and said he hoped the threats toward the student would stop.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />----<br />?
